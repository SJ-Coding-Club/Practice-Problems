# Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of health based on weight. It can 
# be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by 
# the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user 
# to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. 
# Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters
