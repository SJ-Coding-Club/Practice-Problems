### Java or Python for beginners?
#### Python
- Python is simpler and more beginner-friendly with a much easier learning curve.
- Python syntax is very simple
- Python is popular as a scripting language, but is also used in larger apps. It's very good for data analysis and machine learning.
- Python is very easy to read. It is almost like pseudocode. This helps beginners learn early programming concepts 

#### Java
- Java is a little bit more complicated and has a bit more of a learning curve
- Java syntax is slightly more complicated 
- Java can be used to develop Android apps, web applications, and common desktop programs
- I have found that Java makes more advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures easier to understand. 

If you don't know what you want to accomplish, I would recommend learning Python because of the convenience and readability it offers beginners.
