 * and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the
 * following formula:
 * 
 *      futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^(numberOfYears x 12)
 *      
 * For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number
 * of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98
