 * Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an 
 * initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt 
 * the user to enter the amount of water in grams and the initial and final
 * temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is:
 * 
 *      Q = M * (finalTemperature - initalTemperature) * 4.18
 * 
 * where Q is heat in Joules, M is mass of water in grams, temperatures are
 * in degrees Celsius, and the specific heat of water is 4.18 Joules per gram 
 * degrees Celsius
