/**
 * 2.6
 * Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the
 * digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its
 * digits is 14.
 * 
 * Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove
 * the extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93
