/**
 * 2.1 
 * Write a program that reads a celsius degree in a double value from the
 * console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result. The formula
 * for the conversion is as follows: 
 * 
 *      fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
 * 
 * Hint: in Java, 9/5 is 1, but 9.0/5 is 1.8
 * You will need to import + use some type of input class, such as Scanner.
