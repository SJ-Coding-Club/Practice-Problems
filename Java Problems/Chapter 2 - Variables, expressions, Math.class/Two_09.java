 * Average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided 
 * by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following 
 * formula: 
 *        a = (v1 - v0) / t
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity 
 * v0 in meters/second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second and the 
 * time span t in seconds, and displays the average acceleration.
