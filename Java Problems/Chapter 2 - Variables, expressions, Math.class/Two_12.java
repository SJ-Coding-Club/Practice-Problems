 * Given an airplane's acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute
 * the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the
 * following formula:
 * 
 * length = v^2 / 2a
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second and the
 * acceleration a in meters/second squared, and displays the minimum runway
 * length
